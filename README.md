# Contentstack CLI


Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

CLI supports content management scripts through which you can perform the following tasks:

- Bulk publish content
- Export content
- Import content
- Clone Stack
- Seed Stack from GitHub
- Perform Launch operations
- Migrate content
- Migrate HTML RTE to JSON RTE content
- Change Master Locale
- Use Bootstrap plugin
- Use Tsgen plugin
