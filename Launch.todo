    ☐ Manage Mutation: importProject, createDeployment @note 
  ☐ List environments in project
    ☐ Manage Query: Environments @note
  ☐ List deployments
    ☐ Manage Query: Deployments @note 
  ☐ Open environment URL (Need clarification) @todo
  ☐ List deployment/backend logs
    ☐ Logs Query: getLogs @note
  ☐ Run cloud functions locally (Need clarification) @todo
  ☐ On GitHub authentication if user selects "only select repository".? (Need clarification) @todo
    ☐ If it's only one repo should we need to show it as dropdown option.?

  Queries:
    ☐ What is the pagination default limit.?
    ☐ How much record can be queried on one request.?
    ☐ Will it be possible to change "Mutation -> importProject -> projectType", "Query -> Repositories -> provider", "sortBy", etc., as an ENUM if it's types/list is constant.?

GraphQL Endpoints:
  ☐ Manage - https://dev-venus-new.csnonprod.com/contentfly-api/manage/graphql
  ☐ Logs - https://dev-venus-new.csnonprod.com/contentfly-api/logs/graphql

Recourses/Utilities may helpful to achieve end goal:
  ☐ open // LINK https://www.npmjs.com/package/open - Open link to browser

Note:
  ☐ Connected app - To check if github connected.!
